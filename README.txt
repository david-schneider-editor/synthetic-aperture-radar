This repository contains just a script for Octave (a free alternative to Matlab). This script contains
some minor modifications to the one that Greg Charvat authored and made available at the MIT Open
Courseware site. The modifications do two things:

1. Avoided a matrix rotation that caused problems on my machine (perhaps because of memory limitations)

2. Output a black-and-white image, which I thought would make for a better transparent overlay on color aerial photography

The modified script is included in in hopes that some might find it useful.
